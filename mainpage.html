<div> <p class="blocktext" class="d">The door to apartment 307 opens and a beaming little jumpy boy —Gabriel— appears; half a second later, infant on her arm, a tall and gracious presence arrives. “We don’t just run into the hallway.” [The boy halts and the woman] She motoins him to come back and adjusts the baby and smiles. “Please, come in.” 
I feel like it should just be focused on her at this point...

Jaleesa Mone’t Graham is a mother to three young kids and a working actress and model. Her family and professional lives place demands on her time and spirit, and she navigates these challenges with a limb difference. Jaleesa was born without the lower half of her right arm, a fact that has never stopped her from pursuing her dreams of a successful career as an actress as well as a rich and loving family life. 

Expressing her vibrant beauty sometimes requires her to adapt to her physical surroundings in inventive ways. For example, she has developed a hack for doing her hair that makes use of available surfaces in her bathroom. </p></div>
